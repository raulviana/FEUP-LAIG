# FEUP-LAIG
Repository for the "Laboratory of Graphical Interfaces and Applications" course

## Tools
JavaScript, WebGL, CGF

## Usage
To test the program you will need to setup a server. This can be done in multiple different ways. The simpler and quicker is to use Python to host the server: ''' python -m http.server 8080 ''' Just run it from one of the projects root. Another option is to use a chrome extension: *web server for chrome* if you're using this browser.

## Description
The project goal was to develop three simple scenes to apply theoretical concepts.
- Scene one and two represent a room, with a table and a couple of chairs. The table has an aquarium in it.  The first scene is static, with only interaction being turning on and off the several lights. The second one has an animation done with the keyframe technic and other with a shader representing a security camera to the room. The objects and textures are loaded from an XML file. 
- The third one is a puzzle game with its logic in prolog language. Sadly wasn't possible to integrate the prolog logic, so the interface runs with no game rules, no score, and no ending the game. There are some commands for beginning the game, ending it, and replay it in video mode.
